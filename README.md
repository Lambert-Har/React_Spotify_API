## Access app via
https://spotifyground.netlify.app

## How to use app (Make App yours)

First clone the repo via https://github.com/Lambert-Har/React_Spotify_API.git

1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/.
2. Click "CREATE AN APP".
3. Fill out all fields as directed by Spotify's instructions on how to create an application (you can ignore some of them if they don't apply here), then click CREATE.
4. You'll now have access keys that we need later - copy these into their respective places within the code. In repo open App.js and replace Client ID & Redirect URI with yours.
5. Run 'npm install' from root dir or wherever you cloned repo too.
6. To run locally type 'npm start' at command line after installing dependencies above.
7. Open http://localhost:3000 in web browser.
8. Enjoy!
